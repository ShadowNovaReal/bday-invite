        <p class="lead">Now I'm going to tell you about me. Well this page is <strong>about me!</strong></p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>
          All my life I have lived in Myakka City on a small farm.
          I have been in 4H for 8 years now, raising and showing steers and pigs, (steers are my favorite!)
          This year I started showing my dog, Rosetta, a beautful Rhodesian Ridgeback.
          I've also started shooting my bow in 4H at competitions this year. It has been a lot of fun!

          <br/>
          I am the 7th of 8 siblings, most of them are married and live out of state all over the nation!
          I even became an uncle for the first time at 4 years old and now I'm an uncle 11 times after a whole decade and one year!
          It's fun when they drag me around!
          Especially when my niece fractured my thumb 3 times, once in Miami, Georgia, and another time in Maine.
          All for pulling me around by my thumb, lol!
          Even when they say: <i>"Uncle Kiah!"</i> with their innocent face!
          There really isn't anything you can say to their cute faces!

          <br/>
          I'm homeschooled and also enjoy working the sound booth and tech at church for the past few years.
